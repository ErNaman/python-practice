Python ATM Program Output
In this Python tutorial, learn the basic, common functions when using an ATM machine. This Python tutorial will give a basic overview on creating a class with methods and objects while implementing loops such as while loops and for loops, and if statements.

Note: This Python tutorial is implemented in Python IDLE (Python GUI) version 3.7.

ATM Function Requirements
The first step is to brainstorm what basic transactions are completed at an ATM?

Some of the functions that one can complete at an ATM are below:


 
Input user pin for authentication
Check account balance
Deposit funds
Withdraw funds
Create random generated transaction id
Account interest rate and monthly accrued interest rate
Import Python Module Random
In order to complete the above ATM, we will need to import one Python module; random.

Python Random Module
What does the Random package do in Python?
The Random module allows a program to create random numbers by using the random.randint() function. If we wanted a random integer, we can use the randint function and it will accept two parameters of numbers (lowest and highest).

import random
Create Class and Define Functions
What is a class?
A class is used for creating objects. By creating objects, the objects have variables and a behavior that’s associated with them. Since we are using Python in this tutorial, a class is created by a keyword class. Once the class is created, the object within the class will then be called the instance of the class.

How to define a function?
Now we take the requirements that we created from the above and create functions. We can define the functions to provide the given functionality of the program. The function blocks are started with def and followed with the function name and parenthesis, such as def getId(self).

class Account:
    # Construct an Account object
    def __init__(self, id, balance = 0, annualInterestRate = 3.4):
        self.id = id
        self.balance = balance
        self.annualInterestRate = annualInterestRate
 
    def getId(self):
        return self.id
 
    def getBalance(self):
        return self.balance
 
    def getAnnualInterestRate(self):
        return self.annualInterestRate
 
    def getMonthlyInterestRate(self):
        return self.annualInterestRate / 12
 
    def withdraw(self, amount):
        self.balance -= amount
 
    def deposit(self, amount):
        self.balance += amount
 
    def getMonthlyInterest(self):
        return self.balance * self.getMonthlyInterestRate()
